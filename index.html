						Hi! Welcome to my page! My name is Yunke, A.K.A. Drake! I'm now a computer science student pursing my master degree at Tufts University. I'm now living in Boston, MA with a cat. I will graduate from Tufts at the end of Dec, 2020. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I like playing basketball, badminton and video games. FIFA and World of Warcraft is now my main field. Besides, I'm also a big fan of Japanese anime. I have watched at least one hundred episodes. Let me know if you need some recommendations! During recent days, I like watching history related films and reading philosophy books.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm a lazy and senior procrastinator. On the Internet, I act to be talktive and friendly, but in reality I'm a —— using some popular terms —— super social distancing guy. Sadly I'm not being this way until I studied computer science, so to be honest I really don't recommand my friend study computer science. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As you can see, my English writing skill is awful, seems like a schoolboy who didn't graduate. If you have this sense, I have to admit your good vision. Thant's right! I'm a foreigner from China, and what may surprise you more may be that my spoken English probably even worse? But I'm practicing! And now let's talk some business.
					</p>
					<p>
						I do have working experience and internship, for more details you can click the labels above(which takes some effort work on it, just use them!). General speaking, I'm a responsible person in my work time,  me and my colleague take along with each other (at least I think so), and my boss thought highly of me. I evaluate myself as a reliable person in company, and I think this is your opportunity to find a treasure like me :)
